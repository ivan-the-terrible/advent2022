## C++

I'm learning C++ and I'm dedicating the entire challenge to this language to boost my proficiency.

These challenges have so far been a great learning tool for getting familiar with a new language!

## So far I've learned:

- Different Languages Implement the Modulo operator differently! C++ does NOT handle the arithmetic as you'd expect when dealing with negative numbers.
  - See Day 2 for discovery
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation#In_programming_languages
